# KrbRelayUp

:exclamation: **Changes in this fork:** add `-u2u` flag which treats provided computer account as a normal **user** account for [performing](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus/pull/137) [RBCD with UPNs](https://www.tiraniddo.dev/2022/05/exploiting-rbcd-using-normal-user.html). Only available for the `RELAY` phase (will not work with `SPAWN` or `FULL`).

Simple wrapper around some of the features of [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus/) and [KrbRelay](https://github.com/cube0x0/KrbRelay) (and a few other honorable mentions in the acknowledgements section) in order to streamline the abuse of the following attack primitive:

0. (Optional) New machine account creation ([New-MachineAccount](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Powermad/blob/master/Powermad.ps1))
1. Local machine account auth coercion ([KrbRelay](https://github.com/cube0x0/KrbRelay))
2. Kerberos relay to LDAP ([KrbRelay](https://github.com/cube0x0/KrbRelay))
3. Add RBCD privs and obtain privileged ST to local machine ([Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus/))
4. Using said ST to authenticate to local Service Manager and create a new service as NT/SYSTEM. ([SCMUACBypass](https://gist.github.com/tyranid/c24cfd1bd141d14d4925043ee7e03c82))

**This is essentially a universal no-fix local privilege escalation in windows domain environments where LDAP signing is not enforced (the default settings).**

**UPDATE:** [Here](https://gist.github.com/tothi/bf6c59d6de5d0c9710f23dae5750c4b9) is an excellent writeup by [@an0n_r0](https://twitter.com/an0n_r0) on how to perform this attack manually (using the **original tools** for this attack path: [PowerMad](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Powermad)/[SharpMad](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Sharpmad), [KrbRelay](https://github.com/cube0x0/KrbRelay), [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) and [SCMUACBypass](https://gist.github.com/tyranid/c24cfd1bd141d14d4925043ee7e03c82))

### Update - Shadow Credentials Support
I added some features to support this attack primitive using shadow credentials. Note this eliminates the need for adding (or owning) another machine account.

***Note***: *this attack method bypasses the Protected Users (or 'Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated') mitigation due to the S4U2Self abuse.*

1. Local machine account auth coercion ([KrbRelay](https://github.com/cube0x0/KrbRelay))
2. Kerberos relay to LDAP ([KrbRelay](https://github.com/cube0x0/KrbRelay))
3. Generate new KeyCredential and add it to the local machine account's 'msDS-KeyCredentialLink' attribute. ([Whisker](https://github.com/eladshamir/Whisker) and [KrbRelay](https://github.com/cube0x0/KrbRelay))
4. Using said KeyCredential to obtain a TGT for the local machine account via PKInit. ([Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus/))
5. Using the TGT to obtain privileged ST to local machine via S4U2Self and TGSSUB. ([Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus/))
6. Using said ST to authenticate to local Service Manager and create a new service as NT/SYSTEM. ([SCMUACBypass](https://gist.github.com/tyranid/c24cfd1bd141d14d4925043ee7e03c82))

**UPDATE:** [Here](https://icyguider.github.io/2022/05/19/NoFix-LPE-Using-KrbRelay-With-Shadow-Credentials.html) is an excellent writeup by [@icyguider](https://twitter.com/icyguider) on how to perform the ShadowCred method of this attack manually (using the **original tools** for this attack path: [KrbRelay](https://github.com/cube0x0/KrbRelay), [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) and [SCMUACBypass](https://gist.github.com/tyranid/c24cfd1bd141d14d4925043ee7e03c82)) along with the usage of [NimCrypt2](https://github.com/icyguider/Nimcrypt2) to pack the various tools and evade some detection by defensive mechanism.

### Update - ADCS Web Enrollment Support
I added support for relaying Machine KRB auth to ADCS Web Enrollment (instead of LDAP). This eliminates the requirement of LDAP Signing not to be enforced in the domain since this attack does not relay to LDAP.

***Note***: *this attack method bypasses the Protected Users (or 'Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated') mitigation due to the S4U2Self abuse.*

1. Local machine account auth coercion ([KrbRelay](https://github.com/cube0x0/KrbRelay))
2. Kerberos relay to ADCS (HTTP) ([KrbRelay](https://github.com/cube0x0/KrbRelay) and [ADCSPwn](https://github.com/bats3c/ADCSPwn/))
3. Generate certificate request on behalf of the local machine account, submit it to ADCS Web Enrollment and finally retreive the certificate for the local machine account ([ADCSPwn](https://github.com/bats3c/ADCSPwn/))
4. Using said certificate to obtain a TGT for the local machine account via PKInit. ([Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus/))
5. Using the TGT to obtain privileged ST to local machine via S4U2Self and TGSSUB. ([Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus/))
6. Using said ST to authenticate to local Service Manager and create a new service as NT/SYSTEM. ([SCMUACBypass](https://gist.github.com/tyranid/c24cfd1bd141d14d4925043ee7e03c82))


## Usage
```
KrbRelayUp - Relaying you to SYSTEM

FULL: Perform full attack chain. Options are identical to RELAY. Tool must be on disk.

RELAY: First phase of the attack. Will Coerce Kerberos auth from local machine account, relay it to LDAP and create a control primitive over the local machine using RBCD or SHADOWCRED.

    -cet (--CertificateTemplate)      Certificate template to request for (default=Machine)


SPAWN: Second phase of the attack. Will use the appropriate control primitive to obtain a Kerberos Service Ticket and will use it to create a new service running as SYSTEM.

## TODO
- [x] Code refactoring and cleanup!!!
- [x] Add ShadowCred attack as a RELAY method
- [ ] Add TGTDELEG attack  in SPAWN method to be used in Network Service->SYSTEM scenarios (potatoes alternative)
- [x] Fix the issue I'm having trying to combine the RELAY and SPAWN methods into one run so it can be used as one complete command. Probably has something to do with the fact that both RELAY and SPAWN functionalities rely on hooks during the initialization of the COM Server (Once RELAY initializes its COM Server the SPAWN can't re-initialize it to place its hooks as well)

## Mitigation & Detection
* Enforce LDAP Signing and LDAP Channel Binding to mitigate the relay of the machine account KRB auth to LDAP. This can be configured via the "Domain Controller: LDAP server signing requirements" GPO. (Thank you [Will Dormann](https://twitter.com/wdormann) for your [tweet](https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1518999885550440451) on this matter)
* Make the attack requirements harder to obtain by setting the [MS-DS-Machine-Account-Quota attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-ms-ds-machineaccountquota) in AD to **0**, thus removing the ability of any user to add a new machine account to the domain. This is a dangerous default setting in AD - make sure you change it.
* Setting the flag "Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated" on all admin accounts (or put them in protected users) would make it so there is no account with the privileges required that can be delegated in order to complete the attack path. (Thanks to [Christoph Falta](https://twitter.com/cfalta) for this [tweet](https://twitter.com/cfalta/status/1519309206230339585))
* Mitigation for ADCS Relay - Enforcing the use of TLS on the ***certsrv*** site and enabling ***Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA)*** in IIS will prevent the relay to ADCS. (Thanks to [Will Dormann](https://twitter.com/wdormann) for pointing that out in his [tweet](https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1528944331922583552), this also was mentioned in [Dirk-jan Mollema](https://twitter.com/_dirkjan) post on [Relaying Kerberos over DNS using krbrelayx and mitm6](https://dirkjanm.io/relaying-kerberos-over-dns-with-krbrelayx-and-mitm6/))
